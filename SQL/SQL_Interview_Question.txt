Primary vs unique

1.The primary key does not store null values, whereas the unique key does.
2.A table can only have one primary key, whereas it can have multiple unique keys.
3.Primary key enforces entity integrity whereas unique key enforces unique data.
4.The primary key, by default, creates clustered index.The unique key, by default, creates a non-clustered index.
5.example

CREATE TABLE Student
(
Student_Id number PRIMARY KEY, 
Student_name VARCHAR2(150), 
roll_number number
);

CREATE TABLE House
(
House_Number number UNIQUE, 
House_Name VARCHAR2(150), 
House_Address VARCHAR2(250)
);


Entity integrity is concerned with ensuring that each row of a table has a unique and non-null primary key value


Cluster index vs non-cluster index

A clustered index is used to define the order or to sort the table or arrange the data by alphabetical order just like a dictionary.A non-clustered index collects the data at one place and records at another place.


Join
inner join
Oracle INNER JOINS return all rows from multiple tables where the join condition is met.

left join --(inner join +any additional records in the left table)
--This type of join returns all rows from the LEFT-hand table specified in the ON condition and only those rows from the other table where the joined fields are equal (join condition is met).

--The Oracle LEFT OUTER JOIN would return the all records from table1 and only those records from table2 that intersect with table1.


right join --(inner join + additional records from the right table)
--This type of join returns all rows from the RIGHT-hand table specified in the ON condition and only those rows from the other table where the joined fields are equal (join condition is met).
--The Oracle RIGHT OUTER JOIN would return the all records from table2 and only those records from table1 that intersect with table2.

Full Outer Join
 A full outer join contains all records of both the left and right tables.


Constraints
A rule that restricts the values in a database is called constraints
Oracle Constraints clause provides data integrity to the data.
Oracle has multiple types of constraints for multiple purposes.

1. NOT NULL
This will enforce the column to always have a value and it will not allow any NULL record to be added in the column.
We will add NOT NULL constraint using both CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE constraint.

CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
student_id number NOT NULL)

ALTER TABLE STUDENT MODIFY AGE number NOT NULL;


2. UNIQUE
This constraint in Oracle ensures that all the values of the column are different from each other and there are no duplicates

CREATE TABLE student (
student_id number UNIQUE)

ALTER TABLE STUDENT ADD UNIQUE(student_id);


3. PRIMARY KEY
Primary key constraint uniquely describes each value of a column. No duplicates or NULL value is allowed. One important point is that a table can have only one primary key.

CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
student_id number PRIMARY KEY)

ALTER TABLE STUDENT
ADD PRIMARY KEY (student_id);

4. FOREIGN KEY Constraints.
A foreign key is a field which refers to the PRIMARY KEY of another table and the table which actually has the foreign key is called child table. 

CREATE TABLE Orders(
OrderID number PRIMARY KEY,
student_id number REFERENCES student(student_id)
);

ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(student_id);


5. CHECK Constraint
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value of the range that can be placed in a column. In case we want to restrict certain values in a column or a table we introduce the check constraint. 

CREATE TABLE student (
student_id int NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(25) NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(25),
Age int CHECK (Age>=18)
);
