MongoDB


MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL() database.MongoDB is a JSON document datastore. 
It allows you to store and query JSON style documents with a few smarts on top.
Mongo DB is schema less structure
Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses 
sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.

Schema is not strict(dynamic schema)
Data store in mongo db as jason object
Retrival process is fast(performance is good)
support geoasptial query
easily integration with big data hadoop
highly scalable

There are two methods for addressing system growth: vertical and horizontal scaling.

Vertical Scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single server, such as using a more powerful CPU, adding more RAM, 
or increasing the amount of storage space. Limitations in available technology may restrict a single machine from being 
sufficiently powerful for a given workload

Horizontal Scaling involves dividing the system dataset and load over multiple servers, adding additional servers to 
increase capacity as required. While the overall speed or capacity of a single machine may not be high,each machine 
handles a subset of the overall workload, potentially providing better efficiency than a single high-speed high-capacity server.

Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database
A document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema. Dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection 
do not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data.

write concern as “the level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for write operations to a standalone mongod or to replica sets or 
to sharded clusters. Simply put, a write concern is an indication of 'durability' passed along with write operations to MongoDB.

Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS
Schema less − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
Structure of a single object is clear.
No complex joins.
Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.
Tuning.
Ease of scale-out − MongoDB is easy to scale.
Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.
Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data.

Why Use MongoDB?
Document Oriented Storage − Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents.
Index on any attribute
Replication and high availability
Auto-sharding
Rich queries
Fast in-place updates
Professional support by MongoDB

To display database, you need to insert at least one document into it.

install pymongo library(if not installed)
import pymongo
connecct to pymongo server(Connect to database server)
connect to database(connect to specific database)
connect to collection (connect to specific table within connected database)


Command
r--when we pass raw value to connection i.e username and password
f--when we pass variable which consist of credential to connection i.e username and password

Find the list of databases present in mongodb server
print(dbcon.list_database_names())

to check the id of inserted data
print(information.inserted_ids)

limiting the numbers of rows to load in RAM
result=information.find().limit(2)

to find specific number of row from collections
result[3] 

Sorting data
query={'last_name':'Pandey'}
result_det=information.find(query).sort('last_name',-1)

Retrive specific column
result=information.find({},{'last_name','first_name'})

find all the data from collection or table
result=information.find() 


Drop database existine working database.
db.dropDatabase()

Use specific database
use database_name

use collections 
databasename.collectionname.operation(which is want to perform on the given table or collection)

Remove all element or documents of given collection 
db.collectionname.remove({})

Update the details
update={'Age':21}
new_value={'$set':{'Age':29}}

x=collection.update_many(update,new_value)
print(x.modified_count)

x=collection.update_one(update,new_value)


Find index within the given collection
db.collectionname.getIndexes()

Create index within the collection
db.collection.creatIndex()

insert details in collection
db.collection.insert_one()

insert many record in collection
db.collection.insert_many()

finding version of mogodb
version() or
db.version()

#find the number of row or documents in collection 
collectionsdb.count_documents({})

Create index
collectionsdb.create_index([("item",pymongo.ASCENDING)],unique=True)

Retrive the index name
list(collectionsdb.index_information())

Delete the document from collections
db.collection.deleteOne()
db.collection.deleteMany()

Delete command
del_query={'email_id':'Nit'}
delete=information.delete_one(del_query)

Find the number of row deleted
print(delete.deleted_count)


del_query={'email_id':'Nit'}
delete=information.delete_many(del_query)

delete all row from table(No need to provide any argument)
information.delete_many({})

Drop collection
collection_drop=mydb['employeedetails']
collection_drop_final=collection_drop.drop()

update the details in documents 
db.collection.updateOne() 
db.collection.updateMany() 
db.collection.replaceOne() 



Ordered vs Unordered Operations
Bulk write operations can be either ordered or unordered.

With an ordered list of operations, MongoDB executes the operations serially. 
If an error occurs during the processing of one of the write operations, MongoDB will return without processing any remaining write operations in the list.

With an unordered list of operations, MongoDB can execute the operations in parallel, but this behavior is not guaranteed. 
If an error occurs during the processing of one of the write operations, MongoDB will continue to process remaining write operations in the list.

Retryable writes allow MongoDB drivers to automatically retry certain write operations a single time if they encounter network errors, 
or if they cannot find a healthy primary in the replica sets or sharded cluster. 

Retryable reads allow MongoDB drivers to automatically retry certain read operations a single time if they encounter certain network or server errors.



Tools for creating and manipulating SON, the Serialized Ocument Notation.
Regular dictionaries can be used instead of SON objects, 
but not when the order of keys is important. A SON object can be used just like a normal Python dictionary.
A subclass of dict that maintains ordering of keys and provides a few extra niceties for dealing with SON. 
SON provides an API similar to collections.OrderedDict from Python 2.7+.



If the connection string does not specify a database/ you must specify a slash (/)
